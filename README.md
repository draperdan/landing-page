# landing-page

Simple landing page about myself for my dandraperdesign.com domain.

## To-Do:

• Find fonts to use. I keep trying different combinations of Google Fonts but haven't decided yet. Looking for something skewing more soft and playful to appear inviting.

• Figure out best approach (probably SVG) to creating row of contact icons, how to align them in a row, how to make them highlight on mouseover.

• Icons will be:
  - Mail
  - Twitter
  - Dribbble
  - LinkedIn
  - Instagram
  
• Where to host simple site. My domain dan draper design dot com will be the URL.
